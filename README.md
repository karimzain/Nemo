Header:

Consider adding a brief tagline after the title that succinctly captures the essence of the project. For example, "Nemo: An inclusive quiz game for children with dyslexia and motor disabilities."
Features:

Instead of bullet points, you could use a combination of headings and concise descriptions to further highlight each feature and its benefits. For example, under "Eye tracking and hand tracking gameplay," you could write something like: "Experience gameplay like never before using your eyes and hands. Nemo offers an intuitive and inclusive way to interact with the game, making it accessible for everyone."
Technologies:

You could list the versions of the core technologies used for better clarity. For example, "Python 3.8" instead of just "Python 3.x."
Project Structure:

Briefly explain the purpose of each folder within the project structure to give users a better understanding of the organization.
Installation and Usage:

Consider creating a dedicated "Documentation" section with detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and gameplay for different user types (developers, gamers, etc.).
Contributing:

Elaborate on the preferred contribution methods for each type of involvement (bug reports, pull requests, feedback). You could also create a separate "Contributing Guide" document for more thorough instructions.
Contact:

Consider adding your email address or another easily accessible contact method alongside your LinkedIn link.
Overall, your readme structure is solid, and these suggestions are just minor tweaks to further enhance its clarity and informativeness. Keep up the great work on this valuable project!
